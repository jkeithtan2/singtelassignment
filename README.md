Code took slighlty longer than an hour and a half because of drawing of UML diagram and
writing of README file.

Animals was composed of multiple behaviors, flying, swimming, singing, makingsounds, 
possessing unique features and walking. 

Animals are created using an animal factory class. This animal factory class builds animals according
to their desired behaviour by utilizing the behavioural interfaces. 

Attached below is a UML diagram that gives an overview of the program design
